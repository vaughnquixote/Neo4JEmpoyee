I chose to build the api using Java and Spring Boot.  The relevant code can be found in the
~/Neo4JEmployee/src/main/java directory. The application requires a Neo4J database server to be
running at "localhost:7687" It will make the nodes in the default database.

To run the application you can use the following steps:

Navigate to the directory via the command line. Once there you can start the spring boot application
by running the jar file in the target directory by writing;

java -jar target/Neo4JEmployee-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Then in a new command line window the following commands will allow you to create employees and
get all employees:

curl -X POST localhost:8080/create/$name/$id
  This will create an employee with the name and id that you provide in the url.
  id should correspond to an integer value

curl localhost:8080/getemployees
  This will return all the employees in the database as a list, should print to
  the terminal as a list of jsons with the appropriate attributes

curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/deleteemployees
  This will delete all of the nodes in the database.

Thank you for the opportunity and all the best!
